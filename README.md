# RI-DOH-Public

This is R code written for water quality analysis for ~70 beaches across ~15 years in Rhode Island. I test whether water qualities exceed policy thresholds, and conduct trend analysis for beaches over months and years. Moving forward, I will create more automated and scalable scripts to analyze all beaches (and the 2-4 water measuring stations at each beach).
